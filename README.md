The goal of this project is to characterize the epigenome in chronic kidney disease using disease relevant tissue (microdissected human kidney tissue). I analyzed DNA methylation data (raw data files and codebook available via external harddrive). DNA methylation was measured using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. The dataset includes kidney samples from patients with chronic kidney disease and controls. The Rcode file located in this repository includes relevant code for analysis based on the final project template.
